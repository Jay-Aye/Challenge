# Welcome to the Peoplebench Vue Code Challenge: 
# Apex Charts Integration

We're delighted to have you join our coding challenge, where we're seeking your expertise in modifying an existing Vue project and integrating Apex Charts for data visualization. Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework, combined with Apex Charts, a charting library, provides an excellent platform for creating dynamic and interactive charts.

## Estimated duration

This task is estimated at taking 2 - 3 hours

## Challenge Overview:

Your objective is to enhance our Vue project by seamlessly integrating Apex Charts to present insightful visualizations based on provided datasets. Utilizing a set of data points representing various metrics, your task is to incorporate these charts into our Vue application.

## Requirements:

1. Create a single Apex Mixed Line & Column chart
2. The Column will represent staff FTE count (staff.json)
3. The Line will represent pupils per staff member (pupils.json)
4. Create a list of positions as a menu so when clicked they will update the chart with the positions dataset
5. Ensure the charts are user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and effectively convey information from the datasets.

## Datasets:

The datasets required for this challenge are available in JSON files found in the repo under the /data folder.
- `Staff.json` represents the total amount of Full Time Employees (FTE)
- `Pupils.json` represents the pupils per staff member

Treat the JSON files the same way you would treat the response from an API call.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the existing Vue project from [provide the GitHub repository link].
2. To run the project, from the root of the project run `npm install` `npm run serve`
3. Install and configure Apex Charts within the Vue project.
4. Modify the Vue components to seamlessly integrate and display the charts based on the datasets.

## Submission Guidelines:

Upon completing the challenge, submit a link to your modified Vue project on GitHub. Include any necessary instructions for running the project locally.

**Note:** Feel free to leverage the full capabilities of Vue.js and Apex Charts to enhance the user experience. Creativity and attention to detail will be highly valued in your submission.

We're excited to see how you elevate our Vue project with Apex Charts. Best of luck, and we look forward to reviewing your work!
